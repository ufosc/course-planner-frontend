### Report Bug 

Please provide a detailed description of the bug. Include what was happening before the error, all settings, and test results. This helps us more quickly identify and solve any problems. Create an [Issue][Issues] with this description and add a bug label. We will do our best to respond quickly to it. 

### Request a Feature

Check to see if the feature is already listed in our [Projects][Project]. If it's not, describe the feature and why it would be beneficial. Create an [Issue][Issues] with this description and add a feature enhancement label. We will do our best to respond quickly to it. 

## Style Guide 

Use our [.editorconfig](.editorconfig) to help automatically format your code. A short list of what we require. 
- Use descriptive names for everything 
- Make meaningful comments often
- Indent with tabs, use spaces everywhere else
- Put curly braces on a new line
- Keep line length under 100 characters 

For a longer more descriptive list, check out our club's [general style guidelines](https://github.com/ufosc/resources/blob/master/coding-guidelines/general-style.md).

### Example 

```typescript
/**
 * Create a degree, major or minor
 * @param name Name of degree 
 * @param requiredCredits Number of required credits
 * @param requiredCourses List of required courses
 */
constructor(name: string, requiredCredits: number, requiredCourses: Course[])
{
  // Add the attributes to the degree
  this.name            = name;
  this.requiredCredits = requiredCredits;
  this.requiredCourses = requiredCourses;
}
```
